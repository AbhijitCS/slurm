%P — Partition name
Displays the partition(s) for the node(s).
%A — Availability of the partition
Displays whether the partition is available or down (e.g., up, down).
%T — Node state
Shows the state of the node, such as idle, allocated, draining, down, etc.
%D — Number of nodes in a partition
Displays the total number of nodes in the partition.
%N — Node list
Displays the names of nodes.
%C — CPU information
Shows the CPU status (e.g., 1/2 means 1 CPU used out of 2 total).
%m — Memory information
Displays memory usage, often shown in a "used/total" format (e.g., 4G/16G).
%l — Time limit for jobs
Displays the time limit for jobs in the partition (e.g., 24:00:00).
%R — Reason for node state
Displays the reason for the node being in its current state, such as DRAINING or ALLOCATED.
%S — Node features
Displays specific node features, such as GPU or special hardware.
%L — Node load
Displays the load on the node.
%b — Total number of CPUs available for jobs
Shows the total CPUs available on the node.

Valid type specifications include:

%all
Print all fields available for this data type with a vertical bar separating each field.

%a
State/availability of a partition.

%A
Number of nodes by state in the format "allocated/idle". Do not use this with a node state option ("%t" or "%T") or the different node states will be placed on separate lines.

%b
Features currently active on the nodes, also see %f.

%B
The max number of CPUs per node available to jobs in the partition.

%c
Number of CPUs per node.

%C
Number of CPUs by state in the format "allocated/idle/other/total". Do not use this with a node state option ("%t" or "%T") or the different node states will be placed on separate lines.

%d
Size of temporary disk space per node in megabytes.

%D
Number of nodes.

%e
The total memory, in MB, currently free on the node as reported by the OS. This value is for informational use only and is not used for scheduling.

%E
The reason a node is unavailable (down, drained, or draining states).

%f
Features available the nodes, also see %b.

%F
Number of nodes by state in the format "allocated/idle/other/total". Note the use of this format option with a node state format option ("%t" or "%T") will result in the different node states being be reported on separate lines.

%g
Groups which may use the nodes.

%G
Generic resources (gres) associated with the nodes.

%h
Print the OverSubscribe setting for the partition.

%H
Print the timestamp of the reason a node is unavailable.

%i
If a node is in an advanced reservation print the name of that reservation.

%I
Partition job priority weighting factor.

%l
Maximum time for any job in the format "days-hours:minutes:seconds"

%L
Default time for any job in the format "days-hours:minutes:seconds"

%m
Size of memory per node in megabytes.

%M
PreemptionMode.

%n
List of node hostnames.

%N
List of node names.

%o
List of node communication addresses.

%O
CPU load of a node as reported by the OS.

%p
Partition scheduling tier priority.

%P
Partition name followed by "*" for the default partition, also see %R.

%r
Only user root may initiate jobs, "yes" or "no".

%R
Partition name, also see %P.

%s
Maximum job size in nodes.

%S
Allowed allocating nodes.

%t
State of nodes, compact form.

%T
State of nodes, extended form.

%u
Print the user name of who set the reason a node is unavailable.

%U
Print the user name and uid of who set the reason a node is unavailable.

%v
Print the version of the running slurmd daemon.

%V
Print the cluster name if running in a federation.

%w
Scheduling weight of the nodes.

%X
Number of sockets per node.

%Y
Number of cores per socket.

%Z
Number of threads per core.

%z
Extended processor information: number of sockets, cores, threads (S:C:T) per node.
